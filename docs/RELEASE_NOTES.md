# EUD Remote Assist Portal — Release Notes

Running changelog for the **portal server and admin UI**. Update this file on every version release.

**Format:** Each release is wrapped in `RELEASE_START` / `RELEASE_END` HTML comments with a `version=` attribute. New entries are added **at the top** (newest first). Automation and the admin portal parse these blocks.

---

<!-- RELEASE_START version=3.1.4 -->
## Version 3.1.4

**App**

- **MDM Override**: Added the ability to instantly bypass the MDM configuration during "Scan to Enroll" if the correct MDM settings password is provided.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=3.1.4 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=3.1.3 -->
## Version 3.1.3

**Portal**

- **UI Updates**: Restructured the App Download page layout to neatly align the QR code to the side, improving readability and aesthetic balance.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=3.1.3 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=3.1.2 -->
## Version 3.1.2

**Portal**

- **Download Page**: Added a QR code to the App Download page to allow easy scanning and downloading of the APK directly to mobile devices.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=3.1.2 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=3.1.1 -->
## Version 3.1.1

**Portal**

- **Enrollment Enhancements**: Implemented multi-use and time-bounded durations for QR tokens.
- **UI Updates**: Separated "MDM Token" and "QR Token" views, added intelligent Expiration and Status columns to the active tokens table, and streamlined token rendering based on type.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=3.1.1 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=3.1.0 -->
## Version 3.1.0

**Portal & App**

- **Constrained Network Detection**: Added intelligent detection for bandwidth-limited environments (e.g., satellite links). Screen capture dynamically scales down resolution and FPS to preserve bandwidth.
- **WebRTC Network Blocking**: WebRTC screen streaming is automatically prevented when a constrained network is detected. The portal now displays a "WebRTC Unavailable" modal to operators, while keeping location and lock commands fully functional.
- **Security Updates**: Applied underlying security enhancements to the application and infrastructure.
- **Custom TURN Server Configuration**: Added support for configuring a custom Coturn TURN server with explicit fingerprinting and listening IP.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=3.1.0 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=3.0.2 -->
## Version 3.0.2

**Portal**

- Explicitly defined the Docker Compose project name to prevent accidental database wiping when the repository folder is renamed.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=3.0.2 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=3.0.1 -->
## Version 3.0.1

**Portal**

- WebRTC UI: Replaced video element with "Stream Failed" placeholder when WebRTC stream fails to establish.
- WebRTC UI: Removed "Retry WebRTC" button when stream is connecting or already active to prevent accidental resets.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=3.0.1 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=3.0.0 -->
## Version 3.0.0

**Portal & App**

- **Compatibility**: The v3.0.0 portal requires the EUD Remote Assist App v3.0.0 to function properly due to the underlying security and naming changes. Older app versions will fail to connect.
- Re-branded and completely renamed the project from CFD Remote Assist to EUD Remote Assist.
- Migrated all infrastructure configurations, docker container namespaces, database identifiers, documentation, and internal code names to the new `eud-remote-assist` standard.
- **QR Code Registration**: Introduced a streamlined enrollment flow allowing new devices to register simply by scanning a dynamically generated QR code directly from the portal UI.
- **Token Security**: Overhauled authentication by introducing secure, short-lived enrollment tokens and encrypted API tokens for persistent device authorization.
- **Security Enhancements**: Implemented stricter API endpoint validation, HMAC verification for critical payloads, and fortified the device gateway service against unauthorized connection attempts.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=3.0.0 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.26 -->
## Version 2.2.26

**Portal**

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.26 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.25 -->
## Version 2.2.25

**Portal**

- Added **Export Device List** link at the bottom of the Devices page. Admins can select specific columns (UID, Name, Model, Phone number, App version, Agency, Last location coordinate, Last location seen date/time) to include in the exported CSV.
- The exported CSV file is named `EUD_export_<date/time>.csv`.
- Display the device name at the top of the data elements list in the individual device info panel.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.25 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.24 -->
## Version 2.2.24

**Portal**

- Disabled browser autocomplete/autofill on the PIN input field in the remote unlock modal to prevent automated browser values from overriding or interfering with PIN entries.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.24 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.23 -->
## Version 2.2.23

**Portal**

- Optimized remote unlock user experience (UX) flow and transitions.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.23 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.22 -->
## Version 2.2.22

**Portal**

- Modified lock device modal wording and verification constraints to match the new operational specifications.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.22 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.21 -->
## Version 2.2.21

**Portal**

- Implemented a WebRTC inactivity warning modal that automatically terminates active streaming sessions upon navigation, tab unload, or idle timeout.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.21 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.20 -->
## Version 2.2.20

**Portal**

- Optimized WebRTC connection signaling handshake offer delay and video capture warmup delay on the device to minimize connection latency.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.20 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.19 -->
## Version 2.2.19

**Portal**

- Fixed video panel size logic for device rotation state and added renegotiation guard rules.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.19 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.18 -->
## Version 2.2.18

**Portal**

- Request inbound keyframes on every `ORIENTATION_CHANGED` layout event to ensure rapid recovery.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.18 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.17 -->
## Version 2.2.17

**Portal**

- After applying a device-initiated renegotiation offer (rotation recovery or PeerConnection restart), re-attach the video element and schedule stream recovery so the viewer resumes when ICE restarts.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.17 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.16 -->
## Version 2.2.16

**Portal**

- Accept device-initiated WebRTC offers during an active stream (rotation renegotiation): answer with a new SDP answer instead of ignoring offers when `signalingState` is stable.
- HTTP signaling replay also applies renegotiation offers when the stream is already active.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.16 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.15 -->
## Version 2.2.15

**Portal**

- Reduce black screen on rotation when `ORIENTATION_CHANGED` arrives before landscape RTP decodes: panel aspect ratio now follows decoded video until `video.videoWidth/Height` updates (reintroduces v2.2.13 `mergeStreamDimensions` behavior).
- Request an inbound keyframe when layout hints (`ORIENTATION_CHANGED` / `CAPTURE_RESIZED`) change during an active stream.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.15 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.14 -->
## Version 2.2.14

**Portal**

- Revert WebRTC viewer connection setup to the v2.2.6 behavior (`useWebRtcViewer`, `RemoteViewer`, `streamDimensions`). Removes 2.2.12–2.2.13 changes: RTP-stats media verification, 90s media deadline, H.264 codec preference, rotation keyframe requests, and hint-vs-frame dimension merge logic.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.14 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.13 -->
## Version 2.2.13

**Portal**

- Fix black screen on device rotation: panel aspect ratio now follows the actual decoded video frame instead of flipping early on `ORIENTATION_CHANGED` hints.
- Request a keyframe when orientation/size hints change so the browser recovers quickly after capture resize.

**Documentation**

- Expanded [android-app-requirements.md](android-app-requirements.md) with full WebRTC diagnosis, control handling, and rotation requirements for the app team.
- Corrected WebRTC troubleshooting in [android-webrtc-requirements.md](android-webrtc-requirements.md) based on `chrome://webrtc-internals` evidence.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.13 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.12 -->
## Version 2.2.12

**Portal**

- Fix indefinite "establishing video stream" state: media timeouts now verify inbound RTP, not just track objects; 90s hard deadline after answer; frame-wait timer no longer resets on duplicate attach.
- H.264 added to WebRTC codec preferences alongside VP8/VP9.

**Documentation**

- Updated [android-webrtc-requirements.md](android-webrtc-requirements.md) for Android team review (connection_secret, ICE, track ordering, HTTP fallback, stuck-connecting symptoms).

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.12 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.11 -->
## Version 2.2.11

**Portal**

- Stop sending duplicate WebRTC offers after the device SDP answer is received (fixes stalled remote assist and unexpected `REMOTE_SESSION_STOPPED` on device).
- Retry WebRTC button now forces a clean renegotiation when a session has failed.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.11 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.10 -->
## Version 2.2.10

**Server**

- WebRTC offers and ICE relayed to devices now include `connection_secret`, matching command auth and fixing Android "Secret mismatch" rejections during remote assist.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.10 -->

<!-- RELEASE_START version=2.2.9 -->
## Version 2.2.9

**Portal**

- **Portal Configuration** — optional GitHub classic `public_repo` token with Apply/Remove (no restart required).
- Default APK lookup remains standard unauthenticated GitHub access; token enables unthrottled repo access.
- Token persisted in `data/portal-settings.json` via Docker volume mount.

**Documentation**

- Added [github-apk-config.md](github-apk-config.md) for GitHub APK lookup and token setup.

<!-- RELEASE_END version=2.2.9 -->
